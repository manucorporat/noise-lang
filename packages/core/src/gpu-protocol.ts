// forcing) and the main thread (which owns the WebGPU device). This is the whole reason browser GPU
// needs anything beyond "call WebGPU": the forcing is synchronous Rust and WebGPU is async-only, so
// the worker cannot await a dispatch. Instead it writes the request into a `SharedArrayBuffer`,
// `postMessage`s the main thread, and blocks on `Atomics.wait`; the main thread runs the async
// dispatch and `Atomics.notify`s the result back. See `gpu-host.ts` (main) and `worker.ts` (worker).
