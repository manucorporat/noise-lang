# PLAN-UNIFORM-INPUTS — inputs as shader uniforms via symbolic scalar values

**Date:** 2026-07-15 · **Status: P0 + P1 LANDED** (interpreter + cache; both emitters + dispatch plumbing, 2026-07-19); P2–P3 pending. Grounded by a full seam map (file:line below).
**Depends on** the landed PLAN-DROP-JIT cost model (`set_prefer_runtime`) — this plan is what makes
that cost model *pay* for input-driven interactivity.

## The thesis

An `input::real(…)` value bakes into the compiled kernel today. `input_value_to_value`
(`eval.rs:810`) returns a plain `Value::Num`, which lifts into the sample-DAG as an `RvNode::ConstNum`
(`draw_lift.rs:567` for operands, `draw_lift.rs:407` for source parameters), and every emitter spells
that constant as a *literal* — WGSL `bitcast<f32>(0x…u)` (`wgsl_emit.rs:532`), WASM `f32.const`
(`wasm_emit.rs:652`). So the shader text — and therefore the pipeline-cache key (`gpu.rs` caches by
shader text) and the compile-cache key (`compile_cache.rs:161` serializes the f64) — **changes when
the input changes**. Every slider drag recompiles.

On the GPU that recompile is *seconds* (turboquant cold-compiles ~2.9 s; noise_colors ~10 shaders).
For an interactive host — the playground slider, a JS caller sweeping inputs — that is the dominant
cost, and it is exactly the case `prefer_runtime` was built to reward but currently cannot, because
each input value is a *different* shader.

**Make value-inputs shader UNIFORMS.** Lower an input as a distinguished graph node whose value is
supplied at dispatch (a uniform read), not baked into the shader. Then the kernel is a pure function
of the program *structure*, stable across input *values* → the pipeline cache hits → **compile once,
dispatch per keystroke.** 15 of 31 corpus examples use inputs; the value ones (`barrier`,
`deductible`, `dither`, `my_stake`, `fm_swing`) are exactly the interactive sliders.

## The one distinction that runs through everything: structural vs value

| kind | examples | lowering | recompile on change? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **structural** | array sizes (`~[n]`), `set_max_samples`, loop bounds (`for i in 0..d`), control-flow `if` on a deterministic value | **force to a concrete scalar at build** — the graph *structure* depends on it | **yes, and correct** (a different `n` is a genuinely different program). Mostly `input::int`. |
| **value** | thresholds (`path < barrier`), source params (`normal(0, k)`), arithmetic operands, signal params | **lower to a uniform-reading `Input` node** — the structure is identical, only the value differs | **no** — the win. Mostly `input::real`. |

An input's kind is decided *by use*, not by declaration: the same input can size an array (structural)
in one place and scale a draw (value) in another. So an input must stay **symbolic** until the context
forces it one way or the other — which is exactly what `Value::Signal` already does for waveforms.

## The model: symbolic scalar values (the `Value::Signal` playbook, scalar)

`Value::Signal(Rc<SigExpr>)` (`signal.rs:91`) is the proven template: a lazy `Rc`-DAG that stays
symbolic through arithmetic (`ops.rs:248` `binop_signal`, `ops.rs:38` unary) and materializes **two
ways** — fold to `f64` when deterministic (`sample_f64`, `signal.rs:145`), or lower to graph nodes
when it has gone dynamic (`materialize_sig_memo`, `ops.rs:454`, `Rc`-identity memoized). The
"has it gone dynamic" predicate is `has_noise` (`signal.rs:119`).

Symbolic inputs are the same shape, one dimension simpler (a scalar, not a per-index window):

```
Value::Sym(Rc<SymExpr>)                       // new Value variant (Value is #[non_exhaustive])
enum SymExpr {
    Input(u32),                               // slot idx — the leaf that must NOT fold
    Const(f64),                               // a promoted scalar (the Konst analog)
    Unary(UnOp, Rc<SymExpr>),
    Binary(BinOp, Rc<SymExpr>, Rc<SymExpr>),  // + transcendentals as the corpus needs
}
```

- `input::real(…)` returns `Value::Sym(Rc::new(SymExpr::Input(idx)))` — `idx` assigned in declaration
  order (today's implicit `input_manifest` position, `eval.rs:180`; add an explicit `idx` to
  `ResolvedInput`, `input.rs:204`). It **also** records the resolved f64 (for structural folding).
- Arithmetic keeps it symbolic, mirroring `binop_signal`: `Sym ∘ Sym`/`Sym ∘ Num` → `Sym`. (`Sym ∘ RV`
  lowers the `Sym` to a node first, then uses the existing RV path.) The scalar-promotion seam is the
  analog of `sig_operand`/`scalar_const` (`eval.rs:1216`/`1184`).
- **Two materializations** (the `SigExpr` two-mode pattern is the whole design):
  - **`force_scalar(&values) -> f64`** — when structure needs a concrete value (array size, sample
    count, loop bound, `if`/index on a deterministic value). Folds the SymExpr with the *current*
    input values. The structure then legitimately depends on the value → structural input, recompiles.
  - **`lower(engine) -> RvId`** — when the Sym enters the RV graph as a *value* (an RV operand via
    `operand_to_rv`/`draw_lift.rs:564`; a source param via `arg_id`/`draw_lift.rs:405`; a signal
    `Konst`; a complex channel; an array element). Emits `RvNode::Input{idx}` leaves + `Binary`/`Unary`
    nodes for the arithmetic — **value never baked.**

## The `Input` graph node

Add `RvNode::Input { idx: u32 }` next to `ConstNum` (`dist.rs:269`), `RvKind::Num`. A numeric leaf
structurally like `ConstNum` but **keyed on the index, never the value.** Then:

- **`simplify.rs` must treat `Input` as opaque** — this is the load-bearing subtlety. `Input` is NOT
  const-foldable (folding it back to a `ConstNum` re-bakes the value). `Input * 2` stays
  `Binary(Mul, Input, Const(2))`. Audit the fold/CSE arms (`simplify.rs`, ~123 `RvNode::` refs);
  `Input` participates in CSE and structural rewrites but never in constant propagation.
- **The cache key keys on `idx`** (`compile_cache.rs:161` currently `push_f64` for `ConstNum`) — a new
  arm `push tag; push_u32(idx)`, no value. Two forcings differing only in input *values* now produce
  the **identical** key → the compiled artifact is identical → pipeline/compile cache **hits**.
- **Backends read the value at runtime, not from the node:**
  - **interp** (`bytecode.rs:524` emits `Inst::ConstNum`): add `Inst::Input { dst, idx }` that fills
    the column with `input_values[idx] as f32`; the `Runner` carries the input-values slice.
  - **WGSL** (`wgsl_emit.rs:532`): emit `P.inputs[idx]` where a const is baked today; same redirect in
    `draw_expr` (`wgsl_emit.rs:675`) for an input-backed source parameter.
  - **WASM** (`wasm_emit.rs:652`): read the input from a params region instead of `f32.const`.

## Runtime plumbing: input values → the kernel

The compiled program records `K` = number of input slots (max idx + 1, small — a handful of sliders).
At forcing time the driver reads the current values (from `input_manifest`/overrides) into `[f32; K]`
and hands them to each backend:

- **interp** — the `Runner` (`backend.rs`) holds the slice; `Inst::Input` reads it. (Structural values
  were already folded at build, so only *value* inputs reach here.)
- **GPU** — extend `struct Params` (`wgsl_emit.rs:722`: today `key, lane0, n`) with `inputs: array<f32,
  K_MAX>` and the `[u32;4]` pack + 16-byte buffer in `dispatch` (`gpu.rs:241,247`). **Uniform alignment:
  a `array<f32>` in a uniform block needs 16-byte stride** — pack four inputs per `vec4<f32>`, or use a
  small fixed `K_MAX` (e.g. 16) padded. Same struct reused by `try_joint` (`gpu.rs:415`).
- **WASM** — the kernel takes 5 i32 params today (`wasm_emit.rs:89`, `OUT/N/K0/K1/LANE0`); add a
  pointer to an input-values region the host writes before calling, threaded through `wasm_host.rs:107`
  (`inst.exports.kernel(…)`). (A memory region beats new params — `K` varies per program.)

## Phases

**P0 — the symbolic model + `Input` node, interpreter only (the foundation).** `Value::Sym` + `SymExpr`
+ arithmetic + `force_scalar`/`lower`; `RvNode::Input`; `simplify` opacity; `bytecode` `Inst::Input` +
the `Runner` input-values slice; the cache key on `idx`. **Gate:** forcing the same program at two
*different* input values compiles **once** (compile-cache hit, provable via `backend::probe`), and every
result is bit-identical to today's baked-const behavior (`Input` reads the same `val as f32`).

**P1 — both emitters + the dispatch plumbing (the win).** WGSL `P.inputs[idx]` + the `gpu.rs` params
buffer; WASM input-region + `wasm_host` threading. **Gate:** `NOISE_PROFILE=1` shows `gpu.pipeline:
cache HIT` across an input change (today it MISSES); a changed slider re-dispatches with **no**
pipeline compile. Measure turboquant/noise_colors: N runs at N input values pay compile **once**, not N
times.

**P2 — the symbolic paths: signals, complex, arrays.** Make an input flowing through `Value::Signal`
(a `Konst` carrying a `SymExpr`, or a new `SigExpr::Input` leaf that lowers via the noise-walk path,
`ops.rs:467`), `Value::Complex` channels, and `Value::Array` elements lower to `Input` nodes rather
than folding. **Gate:** `am_vs_fm`'s `fm_swing` (a signal param) and `noise_strength` become uniforms.

**P3 — the host API + polish.** A `set_input_value(idx, v)` fast path that re-dispatches without
re-eval where the graph is unchanged (the JS/playground slider loop); confirm the pipeline cache
survives across `run` calls on a held engine; the profiler surfaces the HIT. This is where the
interactive story becomes real for the browser.

## P0 implementation design (grounded — 2026-07-15)

A full seam pass confirmed the plan and pinned the concrete moves. Recording them here so the
implementation is reproducible.

### The runtime channel: how input values reach the interpreter (the load-bearing decision)

The compiled `Program` is the **cached, shared** artifact keyed on structure (idx, not value) — so the
values *cannot* live in it, or a second forcing at a new value would hit the cache and read stale
values. They must be supplied **downstream of the cache lookup**, at run time. Chosen mechanism (mirrors
`compile_cache` / `exec` token exactly):

- A new `crate::input_rt` module: a thread-local holding the engine's `Rc<RefCell<Vec<f32>>>`, installed
  by an RAII guard (`input_rt::install(&self.inputs)`) alongside `stats`/`compile_cache`/`exec` installs
  in `Engine::run`/`run_to_document` (`eval.rs:448`).
- `Engine` gains an `inputs: Rc<RefCell<Vec<f32>>>` field, **parallel to `input_manifest`** — one f32 per
  manifest entry (`value as f32`; bool → 0/1), pushed in `eval_arms.rs:905` right where the `ResolvedInput`
  is pushed. `idx = input_manifest.len()` at declaration ⇒ `inputs[idx]` is always aligned. Unused slots
  for int/bool inputs are free and keep idx = manifest position (no separate counter).
- The forcing drivers (`reduce::run_reduction`, `sampler::for_each_batch`, `for_each_joint_batch`) snapshot
  `input_rt::current()` **once on the driver thread** into an `Arc<[f32]>` and pass it to each `Runner`.
  `Send` `Arc` ⇒ correct under `thread::scope`/rayon fan-out (the CancelToken precedent).
- **Runner creation carries the values:** `Program::runner(&self, inputs: Arc<[f32]>)` (+ the joint twin).
  The `InterpRunner` stores the `Arc<[f32]>`; `run_batch(…, inputs)` reads it. 5 `.runner()` call sites,
  2 trait impls each — bounded. (An input-free forcing passes an empty `Arc`.)

### `RvNode::Input { idx: u32 }` — the exhaustive-match checklist

`RvNode` is matched exhaustively in many places; the compiler enumerates them. Each arm for `Input` treats
it as a **deterministic, draw-free leaf, structurally like `ConstNum` but keyed on `idx`**:
- `dist.rs` — enum variant (`RvKind::Num`).
- `kernel.rs` — `source_ordinals` → 0; `cell_stream_ordinals` → `NO_STREAM`; `walk_cost` → neutral (like
  `ConstNum`) + `supported` → true; `cost` → neutral.
- `simplify.rs` — taint walk → `false` (no placeholder dep); rewrite `Visit` → no children; rewrite `Emit`
  → intern by idx (`Key::Input(idx)`, new `Key` variant); unroll walk arms likewise. **Opacity is free:**
  `as_num`/`as_bool` only recognize `ConstNum`/`ConstBool`, so `Input` never const-folds; the identity
  rewrites (`Input+0 → Input`, `Input*1 → Input`) are sound and desirable.
- `compile_cache.rs::key` — new tag byte + `push_u32(idx)`, **no value** ⇒ two forcings differing only in
  input values produce the identical key.
- `bytecode.rs` — lower stack walk → no children; lower emit → `Inst::Input { dst, idx }`; `produces_scalar`
  → true; `scalar_operands` → none; `apply_remap` → remap `dst`. `run_batch` fills the column with
  `inputs[idx] as f32` (the SAME `val as f32` the old `ConstNum` lane held ⇒ **bit-identical**).
- `wgsl_emit.rs` / `wasm_emit.rs` — P0 only needs them to **compile**; the GPU/wasm emit of `Input` is P1.
  For P0 they get an arm that is unreachable in the interpreter path.
- `gpu.rs` — **decline** (return `None`, fall back to interpreter) for any cone containing an `Input`
  node in P0, so `--features gpu` stays correct before P1 wires the uniform buffer.

### `Value::Sym(Rc<SymExpr>)` — the eval integration (the `Value::Signal` playbook, scalar)

- New `crate::sym` module: `SymExpr { Input(u32), Const(f64), Unary(UnOp, Rc<SymExpr>), Binary(BinOp,
  Rc<SymExpr>, Rc<SymExpr>) }`, with `force_scalar(&[f32]) -> f64` (fold with current values; `Input(i)`
  reads `values[i]`). `Value::Sym` added to the `#[non_exhaustive]` enum; `type_name` → `"number"`;
  `Display` → `force_scalar(current values)` so `${my_stake}` interpolation and `Print` show the value.
- **Scope decision (matches the user's "focus on value inputs"):** only **`input::real`** becomes
  `Value::Sym(Input(idx))`. `input::int`/`bool` stay concrete `Num`/`Bool` (they are structural/control;
  recompiling on their change is correct and they are out of the interactive-slider target set). This
  slashes the ripple — the corpus's value sliders are all `input::real`.
- `ResolvedInput` gains `idx: u32`; the dedup arm (`eval_arms.rs:892`) returns the existing input's
  `Value::Sym(Input(idx))` for a real input (concrete value for int/bool).
- **Arithmetic keeps it symbolic** (`ops.rs::binop`, before the deterministic `eval_binary`): `Sym∘Num` /
  `Sym∘Sym` → `Sym`; `Sym∘Dist` (either order) → lower the `Sym` to an `Input` node, then the existing
  `lift_binary` path. Unary on a `Sym` → `Sym`. A new `binop_sym` mirrors `binop_signal`.
- **`operand_to_rv` (`draw_lift.rs:564`) lowers `Sym` → Input node** (`self.lower_sym(&s)` walks the
  SymExpr, pushing `Input`/`Unary`/`Binary`). This is the entry point for **thresholds & arithmetic-with-RV**
  — `path < barrier`, `loss > deductible`, `loss - deductible`. Covers `barrier`, `deductible`, kelly's
  `my_stake`.
- **Source params** (`unif(-dither, dither)`, `unif(0, max_loss)`): `dist_arg` (`builtins.rs:928`) reads an
  **immutable** graph, so it cannot push an `Input` node. Fix: **pre-lower `Sym` args to
  `Value::Dist(input_node)` in `dispatch_call` (`eval_arms.rs:714`), only for the distribution-constructor
  base names** (`unif`, `unif_int`, `bernoulli`, `normal`, `normal_int`, `normal_complex`, `exponential`,
  `exponential_int`, `poisson`, `geometric`). A `Sym` param there is *always* a value ⇒ lowering to an
  Input `Dist` is always correct, and the existing `DistArg::Rv` + `*Dyn` recipe path then reads the bound
  from the uniform. Covers `dither`, insurance's `max_loss`.
- **Structural sites force to scalar** (`ops.rs::count_arg`, `array_index`; `eval.rs::introspect_count`;
  `set_max_samples`/`set_resolution` via `count_arg`): a `Sym` folds via `force_scalar(current values)`.
  A real input used as an array size / loop bound / index legitimately recompiles on change (structural).
- `scalar_const` (`eval.rs:1184`) / `sig_operand` (`eval.rs:1216`): P0 fallback folds a `Sym` via
  `force_scalar` so a signal `Konst` still works (bakes the value ⇒ recompiles). True signal-uniform
  lowering (`fm_swing`, `noise_strength`) is **P2**.

### What P0 does NOT cover (explicit, deferred)
- Signal params (`fm_swing`, `noise_strength`), complex channels, array elements as uniforms → **P2**.
- WGSL/WASM emit of `Input` + the dispatch buffers → **P1** (P0 declines GPU, falls back to interp; on
  wasm the interpreter fallback carries it).

### P0 landed — what shipped and the deviations from the draft

Everything above is implemented on branch `drop-jit-d0-d4`. Full suite green (lib 200, every
integration suite, CLI, corpus end-to-end). Deviations worth recording:

- **Runtime values are `f64`, not `f32`** (the draft said f32). The `input_rt` cell / `Arc<[f64]>` /
  `run_batch` slice carry the resolved f64; `Inst::Input` narrows with `val as f32` **at the lane
  fill**, exactly as `Inst::ConstNum` does. This is strictly better: lanes stay bit-identical to the
  baked const, *and* `Display` / structural `force_scalar` fold against the exact f64 — so `${my_stake}`
  prints `0.2`, not the f32-rounded `0.20000000298` an f32 store produced (caught in testing).
- **`Program::runner(&self, inputs: Arc<[f64]>)`** carries the snapshot (the draft floated
  `position(…, inputs)`); runner creation is the natural home since values are constant per forcing.
  Drivers snapshot `input_rt::current()` once and clone the `Arc` to each worker (the CancelToken
  precedent); `run_parallel` gained an `inputs` param + `let (next, …) = (&next, …)` reborrows so the
  `move` worker closures capture the shared counter by reference and only *move* their `inputs` clone.
- **Top-level `Sym` result is realized to `Num`** at the end of `run`/`run_to_document` (while inputs
  are still installed) via `realize_result`, so a program that evaluates to a bare input still returns a
  number to the host (`sides * 2 → 12`), preserving the old contract. Intermediate `Sym`s stay symbolic.
- **`simplify` opacity is free**, as predicted: `as_num` only matches `ConstNum`, so `Input` never
  const-folds; it interns by idx (`Key::Input`) and the sound identities (`Input+0 → Input`) still fire.
- **Source-param pre-lower** is exactly the `is_dist_ctor` + `Sym → Dist(lower_sym(s))` map in
  `dispatch_call` — `unif(-dither, dither)` and `unif(0, max_loss)` become uniform-bounded `*Dyn`
  recipes. Confirmed on `dithering` and `insurance`.
- **Signals/complex meeting a `Sym` fall back to force-to-scalar** (bake + recompile) in
  `scalar_const`/`sig_operand`/`noise_sigma`/the complex branch — so `am_vs_fm` (`fm_swing`,
  `noise_strength`) runs correctly today; its signal-uniform lowering is the P2 win.

**Gate (proven by tests):**
- `compile_cache::tests::value_input_change_hits_cache_and_matches_baked_const` — forcing `P(X < d)` at
  `d=0.5` then `d=0.25` on a held engine **adds zero compiles** (cache HIT), the answer tracks `d`, and
  each result is **bit-identical** to the baked-const program (`P(X < 0.5)` / `P(X < 0.25)`).
- `simplify::tests::input_is_opaque_to_constant_folding` — `Input * 2` stays `Binary(Mul, Input,
  Const(2))`; the value never re-bakes.
- CLI: `barrier_option --input barrier=90` → 49% knocked out vs 19% at 80 vs 0.6% at 60 — the uniform is
  read at dispatch through the parallel forcing path, no recompile.

## P1 landed — what shipped and the deviations from the draft (2026-07-19)

Both emitters plus the full dispatch plumbing, native and browser. Deviations and pins worth recording:

- **WGSL:** `Params` gained a fixed, padded input block — `inputs: array<vec4<f32>, 4>` = 16 slots
  (`wgsl_emit::INPUT_SLOTS`), present in EVERY shader so the 80-byte buffer layout
  (`wgsl_emit::PARAMS_BYTES`, pinned by a const assert against the PRELUDE text) never forks.
  `RvNode::Input { idx }` emits `P.inputs[idx/4].{xyzw}[idx%4]`; a slot ≥ 16 declines
  (`Unsupported("input slot beyond uniform capacity")`) — unreachable for real documents since `idx`
  is the manifest position.
- **Dispatch:** the three drivers (`try_reduce`, `reduce_on_gpu`, `try_joint`) snapshot
  `input_rt::current()` ONCE on the driver thread (`gpu::input_uniforms`, `val as f32` — the same
  narrowing `Inst::Input` applies) and hand the block to every dispatch. Native writes it into the
  uniform buffer (`gpu::params_bytes`); the browser rides a new 64-byte SAB region
  (`INPUTS_OFFSET`, `gpu-protocol.ts`) — worker writes per dispatch, `gpu-host.ts` copies it into
  the 80-byte `Params` buffer.
- **WASM:** no signature change — the kernel still takes 5 params. Input values live in the
  **first-page input region** (bytes `0..4096`, `wasm_emit::INPUT_SLOTS = 1024` f32 slots — the page
  was always reserved and unused); `RvNode::Input` is one aligned `f32.load`. The host
  (`nz_kernel_run`/`_cols`) writes the values before EVERY call, because instances are
  content-addressed and shared across programs/forcings. `WasmRunner`/`WasmJointRunner` carry the
  f64→f32-narrowed snapshot; the interpreter fallback keeps the f64 `Arc`, so kernel and fallback
  agree bitwise.
- `kernel::walk_cost` now charges `Input` as neutral (a load ≈ a constant) instead of declining, so
  the wasm gate accepts slider cones.

**Gate (proven by tests):**
- `gpu::tests::an_input_value_change_redispatches_a_cached_pipeline` — on-device: two forcings of
  `P(X < d)` at different `d` compile ONE pipeline (the value-independent shader text is already
  `pipeline_cached` before the second run) and each answer tracks the dispatched uniform.
- `wgsl_emit::gpu_tests::an_input_cone_reads_the_dispatch_value_not_a_baked_one` — the event column
  is bit-identical to the interpreter at each value, and the shader text is identical across values.
- `wasm_emit::tests::an_input_cone_reads_the_host_written_region_bit_identically` — wasmi: the
  kernel column matches the interpreter runner bit-for-bit at each value, and the module BYTES are
  identical across values (the instance-cache key).
- Measured (M4 Pro, shipped CLI): `turboquant.noise` 13.8 s → **0.09 s** on defaults and 36 s →
  **0.8 s** at d=40/m=128 — every heavy forcing sat behind an Input cone, and all of them now run
  on the GPU with cached pipelines.

## Determinism / the two-tier contract

Value inputs are f32 uniforms (the lane type), so the interpreter reads the *same* `val as f32` the
old `ConstNum` lane held → **bit-identical CPU results** to the baked-const behavior; the GPU stays
tier-2 as always. Structural inputs fold to the exact f64 at build (integer sizes/counts), unchanged.
The draw stream is unaffected: `Input` draws nothing (it is a deterministic leaf, like `ConstNum`), so
`kernel::source_ordinals` and the whole draw contract are untouched.

## Risks

| risk | answer |
|---|---|
| **`simplify` folds `Input` back to a constant** (re-baking) | The single most important invariant: `Input` is opaque to constant propagation. A focused audit of `simplify.rs` fold arms + a test that `input * 2` keeps an `Input` node. |
| The structural/value boundary is subtle | It is exactly `SigExpr`'s materialization boundary (fold-vs-lower), which already ships and is tested. Reuse the pattern; the contexts that force-to-scalar are enumerable (array size, sample count, loop bound, `if`/index). |
| `Value` variant ripple | `Value` is `#[non_exhaustive]` with wildcard arms (E2); adding `Sym` is mostly additive, and `Signal` proves the surface is manageable. |
| WGSL uniform alignment / variable `K` | Fixed `K_MAX` padded, or pack into `vec4<f32>`. `K` is tiny (sliders), so a 16-slot padded array is cheap and dodges dynamic-binding complexity. |
| Signal/complex interaction (P2) | Deferred to its own phase; P0/P1 already cover the direct value inputs (`barrier`, `deductible`, `dither`, `my_stake`) — the majority. |
| A structural input that *also* feeds a value use | Works by construction: `force_scalar` at the structural site (bakes the size), `lower` at the value site (uniform). The same input is both a compile-time size and a runtime uniform — no conflict. |

## Success criteria

- **Dragging a value slider does NOT recompile the kernel** — `gpu.pipeline: cache HIT` in the
  profiler across the change; the shipped-CLI cold tax (turboquant 2.9 s) is paid **once** across a
  whole input sweep, not per value.
- Every value input in the corpus (`barrier`, `deductible`, `dither`, `my_stake`, `fm_swing`,
  `noise_strength`) lowers to a uniform; structural `input::int`s still (correctly) recompile.
- Results bit-identical (CPU) / tier-2 (GPU) to today's baked-const behavior — the conformance corpus
  and a new "input value change is invisible to the answer" test both green.
- The interactive loop (`prefer_runtime` on + a held engine + slider changes) runs at dispatch speed,
  not compile speed — the whole point.
